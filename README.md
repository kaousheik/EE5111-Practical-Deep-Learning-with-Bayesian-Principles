# EE5111-Practical-Deep-Learning-with-Bayesian-Principles

This repo contains codes and final presentation we used for the final project for EE5111 (Estimation Theory) course.

In this project we used a Bayesian method **VOGN** for **[Active learning](https://towardsdatascience.com/active-learning-in-machine-learning-525e61be16e5)** and compared the results of the same with **Adam**.

Initially, we used 2D datasets like **Moon** and **Circle** from scikit-learn. We were able to show how quick VOGN was able to reach higher validation accuracy when compared to Adam. After such astounding results in 2D datasets, we replicated the same on MNIST dataset.
